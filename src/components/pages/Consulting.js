                <p>After the initial consultation to discuss the needs and design 
                    specifications for your project, we will brainstorm and generate 
                    multiple CAD prototypes. These designs will be presented to you in 
                    subsequent meetings. This process may undergo multiple iterations 
                    based on client feedback until the final product is developed.
